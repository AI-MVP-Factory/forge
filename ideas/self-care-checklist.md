# Self-Care Checklist

> Celebrate taking care of yourself, one gentle act at a time

## Problem

People know self-care matters but often neglect it, feeling guilty about "unproductive" activities. When they do take care of themselves, there's no celebration - just a quiet checkbox in their mind. This makes self-care feel like another chore rather than a gift they give themselves.

## Solution

A warm daily self-care tracker where users check off simple acts of self-care (hydration, movement, rest, connection, fresh air) and receive AI-powered celebration and encouragement for each one. Transforms self-care from obligation to celebration.

## Emotional Hook

**How should users FEEL when using this?**

Feel PROUD, CELEBRATED, and WORTHY for taking care of themselves. Each checked item should feel like a small victory, with the AI acting as a supportive friend who genuinely celebrates their self-care choices and reminds them they DESERVE to feel good.

## Target User

Busy people who put everyone else first - caregivers, parents, overworked professionals. Anyone who feels guilty about taking time for themselves and needs permission and celebration to prioritize their wellbeing.

## Core Feature

Check off self-care activities from a simple list, receive warm AI-powered celebration for each one that validates their choice and reinforces that they deserve care.

## Success Metric

Completion rate - percentage of users who check at least 3 items per day.
