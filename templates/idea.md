# [MVP Name]

> Replace this with your MVP name

## Problem

What problem does this solve? Who has this problem?

<!--
Be specific. "People waste time" is too vague.
"Busy professionals forget to drink water and feel sluggish by 3pm" is specific.
-->

## Solution

How does this MVP solve the problem?

<!--
Keep it simple. One core feature that solves the problem.
Not a platform. Not an ecosystem. One thing, done well.
-->

## Emotional Hook

**How should users FEEL when using this?**

<!--
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION.
Products succeed by how they make users FEEL.

Examples:
- "Feel CAPABLE and CELEBRATED as creative home chefs"
- "Feel UNDERSTOOD, VALUED, and ENOUGH exactly as they are"
- "Feel PROUD and ACCOMPLISHED after focused work sessions"
- "Feel SEEN and VALIDATED for who they are"

Use emotional words: proud, capable, celebrated, understood, valued, seen, validated, encouraged, supported, confident
-->

## Target User

Who is this for? Be specific.

<!--
Not "everyone". Not "people who want to be productive".
"Remote workers who struggle to maintain focus during afternoon slumps"
"New parents who feel isolated and need daily encouragement"
"Aspiring home cooks who feel intimidated by complex recipes"
-->

## Core Feature

What is the ONE thing this MVP does?

<!--
Resist the urge to list 5 features.
What's the one thing that, if it works, validates the whole idea?
-->

## Success Metric

How will we know this works?

<!--
Pick ONE metric that matters:
- Daily active users returning
- Completion rate of core action
- Emotional survey score
- Time spent in meaningful engagement
-->
