# Forge Vision

> **"Pipelineabuser speed with AI Factory quality"**

## Core Thesis

Products succeed by how they make users FEEL. Not features, but emotions.

Forge exists to ship emotionally-resonant MVPs in hours, not days.

## The Problem

| Approach | Speed | Quality | Emotional Value |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Pipelineabuser | 30 min | Low | None |
| AI Factory | 14 hours | High | 96-100% |

Both extremes fail:
- Too fast = bugs, no emotional resonance, throwaway
- Too slow = bloat, over-engineering, never ships

## The Solution

Forge = **4 hours to quality MVP with emotional validation**

```
Speed of chaos + Quality of process + Emotional intelligence
```

## Principles

### 1. Emotional Value is Non-Negotiable
Every MVP must pass emotional validation before shipping.
This is THE differentiator. Caiden can't replicate this.

### 2. Quality Gates, Not Quality Theater
Only 3 gates that actually run:
- Emotional (mandatory)
- Security (prevents disasters)
- Independence (portfolio protection)

Not 21 gates where 16 are spec-only.

### 3. Native Tools, Not External Dependencies
Use Claude Code's native Task tool with subagents.
Don't depend on Factory AI, Warp, or other platforms.
Self-contained = portable = fast.

### 4. Portfolio-Ready from Day 1
Every Forge MVP is designed to join a portfolio.
Separate domain, separate analytics, separate support.
Independence by default.

### 5. Honest Speed Claims
Not "30 minutes" (marketing BS for CRUD templates).
But "4 hours" (verified, for real MVPs with quality).

## What Forge Is

- A lean MVP generator
- Native Claude Code workflow
- Emotional validation built-in
- 3 essential gates
- ~500 lines of config (not 28,500)

## What Forge Is NOT

- Not a replacement for AI Factory (sibling project)
- Not throwaway clones (quality matters)
- Not cold email infrastructure
- Not external tool dependent
- Not over-engineered process

## Success Metric

Forge validates itself by shipping MVP #5 faster than AI Factory shipped MVPs #1-4, with equal or better emotional value scores (96%+).
